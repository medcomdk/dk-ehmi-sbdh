# EHMI Standard Business Document Header

## Introduction

The EHMI Standard Business Document Header (ehmiSBDH) is a customized version of the PEPPOL SBDH.

It is developed to

- suit the direct messaging of clinical content in EHMI through the eDelivery Network
- handle reliable messaging at the eDelivery network level like VANSenvelope in the VANS network
- handle the XDS Metadata that is needed when MedCom Messages are exchanged as “documents” in the XDS Framework
- serve the ground for EDS Delivery Status
- serve the ground for EHMI Statistics of message exchange
